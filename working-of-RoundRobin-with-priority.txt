Here we are going to solve one example of Round Robin with Priority scheduling to learn how it actually works. 
Q)
PROCESSE	 ARIVAL TIME	  BURST TIME	  PRIORITY
    P1	            5                   4	     6
    P2	            3                   5            0
    P3	            0                   7            4
    P4	            2                   3            5
	Time quantum = 2
	Higher no. indicates higher priority.
	
Sol.

At arrival time 0 process P3 arrives in system for execution.
After the execution of P3 after time quantum of 2 and left burst time is 5, P4 arrives having a	arrival time 2.
So now we have 2 process in ready queue. 
              
              P3       P4

So, firstly we will compare the priority of the processes. Since P4 is having higher priority in the queue so it will execute first.
Until P4 executes p2 will arrive in ready queue.
So now its burst time left is 1

                P4	    P3	     P2

Again we will compare priority, p4 is having higher priority in the queue, so it will execute again till it task gets over or time quantum. 
Now p4 is executed and completed its task having left burst time 0. Thus the total execution time till now is 5.
Now in our ready queue we have   3 processes

                P3	    P2	      P1

Again we compare the priority of the processes among the queue, p1 is having higher priority, so it will execute first in queue.
After the execution of the p1 its burst time left is 2. And total process in the queue is 3

                P3     P2	    P1

Now again we will compare their priority, again p1 is having highest priority so it will execute again.
After the execution of the process p1 its burst tme left is 0,thus it is executed completely.
Now in our ready queue we have 2 processes

                P3	    P2

Similarly as above we will compare priority, p3 is having higher priority so it will execute first.
After the execution of p3 its burst time left is 3.

No. of queues in our ready queue is only 2, among those p3 is having higher priority so p3 will execute till its burst time becomes 0.
After complete execution of p3 our total execution time is 14.

So now only one process is left in our ready queue, thus it will execute completely.
And our total execution is 18.

Now, our all the processes has been executed. 

The process has executed in the following manner with their execution time:
  

      P3	      P4	      P4	      P1	      P1	      P3	        P3	        P3	        P2	        P2
     0-2             2-4	      4-5	      5-7	      7-9            9-11	       11-13	       13-14	       14-16	       16-19
  


So our final table is:

Process	    Arrival Time         Burst Time	  Priority	  CompletionTime     Turn AroundTime     Waiting Time
   (P)              (AT)            (BT)                            (CT)             (TAT)TAT=CT-AT      (WT)WT =TAT-BT
   
   P1	              5	            4                 6	              9	                     4                 0
   P2	              3             5                 0	             19	                     16	               11
   P3	              0             7	              4	             14	                     14	               7
   P4	              2	            3	              5	              5	                     3	               0

Average Waiting Time = 18/4 = 4.5 
Average Turn Around Time = 37/4 = 9.25
